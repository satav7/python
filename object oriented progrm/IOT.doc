$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

- The following libraries will be installed when you install the client library:

httplib2
uritemplate

https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client #to get the above files

http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/en/latest/index.html #to test web apps
- pip install webtest

#WHAT THIS DOES:

WebTest helps you test your WSGI-based web applications. This can be any application that has a
 WSGI interface, including an application written in a framework that supports WSGI (which includes
  most actively developed Python web frameworks â€“ almost anything that even nominally supports WSGI 
  should be testable).

With this you can test your web applications without starting an HTTP server, and without poking 
into the web framework shortcutting pieces of your application that need to be tested. The tests
WebTest runs are entirely equivalent to how a WSGI HTTP server would call an application. By testing
the full stack of your application, the WebTest testing model is sometimes called a functional test, 
integration test, or acceptance test (though the latter two are not particularly good descriptions).
This is in contrast to a unit test which tests a particular piece of functionality in your application.
While complex programming tasks are often suited to unit tests, template logic and simple web
programming is often best done with functional tests; and regardless of the presence of unit tests,
no testing strategy is complete without high-level tests to ensure the entire programming system works
together.

WebTest helps you create tests by providing a convenient interface to run WSGI applications 
and verify the output.

- pip install pycrypto

Python Cryptography Toolkit (pycrypto)
This is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various 
encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.). The package is structured to make adding 
new modules easy.
